							<b>What is Slavehack: Legacy?</b><br /><br />
						</div>
						Slavehack: Legacy is an online hacking simulation
						game. At no time in this game will you actually hack
						or be hacked, as <u>this is a virtual game
						only</u>. Your computer will not be exposed
						to any exploits or actual software other than
						the cookies used to play the actual game. If at
						any time a game-wide exploit has been found that
						affects real computers, an announcement will be
						made for all users and the servers will be taken
						down.<br /><br />

						When you enter the game you'll be given a very
						mediocre computer. In Slavehack, your task is to
						gather computer slaves who will benefit you through
						different tasks including earning you income to upgrade
						your rig.<br /><br />

						In addition to upgrading your rig, you'll also be
						gathering software such as firewalls, malware,
						adware, spyware, rootkits, trojans,
						and more to help you in your endeavors.<br /><br />

						As you venture the web in search of slaves, you
						must be diligent, however. Each website you visit
						will leave a connection log that a player can
						trace back to your own computer and make you their
						slave. Fear not, becoming a slave computer is not
						the end of the world if you've backed up your
						software.<br /><br />

						So what's the goal of the game? Make it to the top
						of the leaderboards.<br /><br />Good luck!
