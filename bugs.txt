- Firefox's text area in logs.php is way too big
- Login displays "activation" error when using an incorrect password (but correct username? Needs more testing)
- Socket.IO displaying connection errors from Node.JS, need to remove it from areas it's no longer needed
- No checks for users accessing the game without logging in, causes MySQL errors
- (IMPORTANT) Need to sanitize user input during registration and logs editing. Currently vulnerable to SQL injection.
- (IMPORTANT) Use this http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-ajaxxml8/ type of implementation to completely replace
  Socket.IO and Node.JS to simplify the game's stack. This will allow a live deployment on Heroku.
